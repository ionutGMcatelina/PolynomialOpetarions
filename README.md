# PolynomialOpetarions
This program does operations for polynomials.
The interface has 3 fields: for the two polynomials to operate with and one for the result.
There are 6 buttons, one for each operation: add, sub, mull, div, derication, integration.
For the first four operation, you must complete the first two fields with polynomials, press a button and the result will be displayed in
the second field. For derivation and integration, it will be used the polynomial from the first field.
If you introduce a wrong polynomial, an error message (it will tell you what polynomial is incorrect) will be displayed when you press a button.
